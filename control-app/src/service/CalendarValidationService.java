package service;
/*
3. service/CalendarValidationService.java

Why:

Ensures business rules like no overlapping events, end > start.

Tasks:

boolean isValid(Event e, CalendarModel model)

Detect overlapping events

Detect invalid time ranges (extra safety)

Java types:

Event, List<Event>, Comparator<Event>

Tip: Use Streams API for filtering and comparisons.
